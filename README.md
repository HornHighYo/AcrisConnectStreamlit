# AcrisConnectStreamlit

My Submission to the Streamlit Connections Hackathon

Working version on streamlit cloud is here https://acris-nyc.streamlit.app/

Using Stremlit St.experimnetal_connection I built a connection to my favorite datasource = New York City Real Estate Data via Acris
Acris provides up-to-date information on recorded real estate transactions in NYC (every deed, mortgage and other recorded document

Utilizes two API's maintained by NYC OpenData to first search recently recorded documents. https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/ACRIS-Real-Property-Master/bnx9-e6tj

And then access the real property information to determine the relevant properties. https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/ACRIS-Real-Property-Legals/8h5j-fqxa
This is only a taste of the insights that you can identify in this data (using the power of Streamlit, Pandas and Python)
